## Background of the Data
The data originally contained a large list of features with documentation in the 'features_info.txt' file found in this repository.
The data comes from measurements of accelerometer data and gyroscope data, both of which measure accelerations.
For our analysis, we only retain measurements which calculated a mean or standard deviation of either an acceleration or a jerk (derivative of acceleration).

Some measurements are the result of a Fast Fourier Transform on the data to make a frequency domain measurement, which is filtered to reduce noise - details on these measurements can be found in the 'features_info.txt' file.

Accelerometer data is often broken down into body and gravitational acceleration to filter out the effect of gravity on e.g. walking up or down stairs.

All data in the original data set are normalized on a [-1,1] scale, which makes them unitless and directly comparable.

## Code Book
Here we list each variable we store with a short explanation of its contents.
All variables have remained normalized on a [-1,1] scale, and so have no units.
